# Covid-19 Tools and visualisations

As part of #OpenDataSavesLives at [ODI Leeds](https://odileeds.org/) we are creating and coordinating resources (data, tools, and visualisations) that are useful for the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Tools and visualisations

* [Local Authority Dashboard](https://odileeds.github.io/covid-19/LocalAuthorities/dashboard/)
* [Local Authority Hexmaps](https://odileeds.github.io/covid-19/LocalAuthorities/hexmap.html)

## Data

We are [collating data sources in an open Google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14AdGyCAOdanClrie4BT4VWnLi47XxZ8Q8etiroxUWQU/edit?usp=sharing).
