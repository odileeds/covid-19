					<p>Data are provided by "Upper Tier Local Authorities" in England &amp; Northern Ireland, and by Health Board in Wales &amp; Scotland. This map shows Local Authorities. In cases where the raw data are provided for a combination of Local Authorities (i.e. for Health Boards or some Upper Tier Local Authorities), each Local Authority in that group is given the same per-capita value (<a href="https://twitter.com/owenboswarva/status/1243606486024105985">UK geography is hard</a>). When you click on one of these Local Authorities you will be shown the total for the UTLA/Health Board along with which Local Authorities are in it.</p>

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>Data are provided by "Upper Tier Local Authorities" in England &amp; Northern Ireland, and by Health Board in Wales &amp; Scotland. This map shows Local Authorities. In cases where the raw data are provided for a combination of Local Authorities (i.e. for Health Boards or some Upper Tier Local Authorities), each Local Authority in that group is given the same per-capita value (<a href="https://twitter.com/owenboswarva/status/1243606486024105985">UK geography is hard</a>). When you click on one of these Local Authorities you will be shown the total for the UTLA/Health Board along with which Local Authorities are in it.</p>

			<h2>About these maps</h2>
			<p>These <a href="https://github.com/odileeds/hexmaps/blob/gh-pages/maps/uk-local-authority-districts-2019.hexjson">Local Authority hex cartograms</a> are created by <a href="https://odileeds.org/">ODI Leeds</a> to help Local Authorities (and similar) get an overview of how their area compares to other parts of the United Kingdom. A hex cartogram gives each Local Authority the same visual weight on the map at the expense of geography. This helps make geographically compact (but often big in population) Local Authorities more easily visible than a geographic map.</p>
