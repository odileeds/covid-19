					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>We calculate a 7-day rolling average (3 days each side of the day in question) of the daily confirmed cases data from Public Health England. This smooths out day-to-day variations and weekend effects. We are using lab-confirmed cases which are dated by when the test was actually done rather than when the result comes in. That means they can take time to process and report. <a href="https://rpubs.com/JeniT/covid19-cases-england-local-authorities">From experience</a>, we ignore the most recent 5 days in the data; after around 5 days the values seem to be much closer to their "final" values and are therefore more reliable.</p>

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>We are using lab-confirmed cases which are dated by when the test was actually done rather than when the result comes in. That means they can take time to process and report. <a href="https://rpubs.com/JeniT/covid19-cases-england-local-authorities">From experience</a>, we ignore the most recent 5 days in the data and calculate the total for the week leading up to that point.</p>
					<p>The date shown at the top is the most recent date for <em>any</em> area in the data and does not necessarily apply to every Local Authority. Click on a specific area to see when it was last updated.</p>

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>We are using lab-confirmed cases which are dated by when the test was actually done rather than when the result comes in. That means they can take time to process and report. <a href="https://rpubs.com/JeniT/covid19-cases-england-local-authorities">From experience</a>, we ignore the most recent 5 days in the data and calculate the total for the week leading up to that point.</p>
					<p>The date shown at the top is the most recent date for <em>any</em> area in the data and does not necessarily apply to every Local Authority. Click on a specific area to see when it was last updated.</p>

					<p>This shows the percentage of deaths registered as being COVID-19 compared to all deaths. The data from ONS only cover England and Wales. It includes all deaths registered from the start of 2020 up to <span class="deaths-date">2021-03-12</span>. It does <em>not</em> show &quot;excess deaths&quot; - that requires comparison with previous years for which we do not have access to the same level of granularity.</p>

					<p>This comes from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-august-2020">HMRC Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme statistics as of August 2020</a>. HMRC publish a breakdown by county, district, or unitary authority. The figures for <em>Westminster and City of London</em> are combined in the raw data so have been duplicated here. The figures for <em>Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly</em> are combined in the raw data so are duplicated here.</p>
					<p>It seems as though the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-september-2020">September release from ONS</a> no longer includes a break down by Local Authority.</p>

HMRC publish a breakdown by county, district, or unitary authority. The figures for <em>Westminster and City of London</em> are combined in the raw data so have been duplicated here.

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>This visualisation <em>only</em> includes grants published under the 360Giving standard and then only if a local authority area is given. Therefore this map includes &pound;<span class="grants-area">455.4M</span> of grants from the 360Giving data. A further <em>&pound;<span class="grants-noarea">0.00</span> of grants without areas are not included</em> on this map.</p>
					<p>360Giving includes grants if the terms "covid", "coronavirus", "pandemic" or "cv19" are used somewhere in the grant description, title, classification or grant programme. This data is based on UK foundations reporting grants using the 360Giving Data Standard. It only includes grants awarded in British Pounds that have already been made (rather than amounts committed to grant programmes). Not all foundations publish their grants as open data, and some publishers do not immediately publish their latest data.</p>
					<p>If you fund grants in the UK and don't already <a href="https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/">publish to the 360Giving Standard</a> please consider it.</p>

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>This visualisation shows the total amount of funding that Local Authorities received from a series of financial packages - from the UK Government - to assist with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Some funds are passed straight through to businesses and individuals rather than supporting local authority budgets; others are a mix of direct support and passed-through funding. Local authorities may also have received funding that is not listed here, because we do not have figures for every fund's individual allocations. These maps don't include funding that has been allocated to combined authorities or the Greater London Assembly.</p>

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>This visualisation shows the per capita amount of funding that Local Authorities received from a series of financial packages - from the UK Government - to assist with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Some funds are passed straight through to businesses and individuals rather than supporting local authority budgets; others are a mix of direct support and passed-through funding. Local authorities may also have received funding that is not listed here, because we do not have figures for every fund's individual allocations. These maps don't include funding that has been allocated to combined authorities or the Greater London Assembly.</p>

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>This visualisation shows the total amount of funding that Local Authorities received for individuals from a series of financial packages - from the UK Government - to assist with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Some funds are passed straight through to businesses and individuals rather than supporting local authority budgets; others are a mix of direct support and passed-through funding. Local authorities may also have received funding that is not listed here, because we do not have figures for every fund's individual allocations. These maps don't include funding that has been allocated to combined authorities or the Greater London Assembly.</p>

			<h2>About these maps</h2>
			<p>These <a href="https://github.com/odileeds/hexmaps/blob/gh-pages/maps/uk-local-authority-districts-2019.hexjson">Local Authority</a> <a href="https://github.com/odileeds/hexmaps">hex cartograms</a> are created by <a href="https://odileeds.org/">ODI Leeds</a> to help Local Authorities (and similar) get an overview of how their area compares to other parts of the United Kingdom. A hex cartogram gives each Local Authority the same visual weight on the map at the expense of geography. This helps make geographically compact (but often big in population) Local Authorities more easily visible than a geographic map.</p>
			<p>The maps of deaths use data published weekly by ONS since the 28th April 2020. A better view would be &quot;excess deaths&quot; but, to calculate that, we would need to know the total number of deaths covering the exact same period during the previous 5 years. If you know where death data by Local Authority is available at the required detail please <a href="https://twitter.com/odileeds">let us know</a>.</p>
			<p>The code is released <a href="https://github.com/odileeds/covid-19">under an MIT Licence on Github</a>. Please add issues on Github.</p>
