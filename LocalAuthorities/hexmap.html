					<h3>Notes</h3>

					<p>This shows the percentage of deaths registered as being COVID-19 compared to all deaths. The data from ONS only cover England and Wales. It includes all deaths registered from the start of 2020 up to <span class="deaths-date">2020-09-02</span>. It does <em>not</em> show &quot;excess deaths&quot; - that requires comparison with previous years for which we do not have access to the same level of granularity.</p>

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>This comes from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-june-2020">HMRC Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme statistics as of June 2020</a>. HMRC publish a breakdown by county, district, or unitary authority. The data from HMRC seems to be reported by 2019 local authorities with these exceptions: they report <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckinghamshire_Council">Buckinghamshire UA</a></em> which only came into existence in 2020 so we have split the Buckinghamshire figure equally between the hexagons for <em>Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, South Bucks and Wycombe</em>. The figure for <em>Westminster and City of London</em> has been split between them. The figure for <em>Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly</em> has been split.</p>

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>This comes from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme-statistics-june-2020">HMRC Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme statistics as of June 2020</a>. HMRC publish a breakdown by county, district, or unitary authority. The data from HMRC seems to be reported by 2019 local authorities with these exceptions: they report <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckinghamshire_Council">Buckinghamshire UA</a></em> which only came into existence in 2020 so we have used the Buckinghamshire figure for <em>Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, South Bucks and Wycombe</em> (which did exist in 2019) and converted its code to E10000002 (2019) from E06000060 (2020); the figure for <em>Westminster and City of London</em> has been used for both; the figure for <em>Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly</em> has been used for both.</p>

					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<p>This visualisation <em>only</em> includes grants published under the 360Giving standard and then only if a local authority area is given. Therefore this map includes &pound;<span class="grants-area">118M</span> of grants from the 360Giving data. A further <em>&pound;<span class="grants-noarea">0.00</span> of grants without areas are not included</em> on this map.</p>
					<p>360Giving includes grants if the terms "covid", "coronavirus", "pandemic" or "cv19" are used somewhere in the grant description, title, classification or grant programme. This data is based on UK foundations reporting grants using the 360Giving Data Standard. It only includes grants awarded in British Pounds that have already been made (rather than amounts committed to grant programmes). Not all foundations publish their grants as open data, and some publishers do not immediately publish their latest data.</p>
					<p>If you fund grants in the UK and don't already <a href="https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/">publish to the 360Giving Standard</a> please consider it.</p>

			<h2>About these maps</h2>
			<p>These <a href="https://github.com/odileeds/hexmaps/blob/gh-pages/maps/uk-local-authority-districts-2019.hexjson">Local Authority</a> <a href="https://github.com/odileeds/hexmaps">hex cartograms</a> are created by <a href="https://odileeds.org/">ODI Leeds</a> to help Local Authorities (and similar) get an overview of how their area compares to other parts of the United Kingdom. A hex cartogram gives each Local Authority the same visual weight on the map at the expense of geography. This helps make geographically compact (but often big in population) Local Authorities more easily visible than a geographic map.</p>
			<p>The maps of deaths use data published weekly by ONS since the 28th April 2020. A better view would be &quot;excess deaths&quot; but, to calculate that, we would need to know the total number of deaths covering the exact same period during the previous 5 years. If you know where death data by Local Authority is available at the required detail please <a href="https://twitter.com/odileeds">let us know</a>.</p>
			<p>The code is released <a href="https://github.com/odileeds/covid-19">under an MIT Licence on Github</a>. Please add issues on Github.</p>
