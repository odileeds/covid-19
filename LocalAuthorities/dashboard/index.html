			<h2 id="risk">Levels of risk</h2>
			<p>Column colours use <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">California's four levels of risk</a>. California use <em>positivity rate</em> and new daily cases per 100k. Unfortunately PHE don't publish the number of tests at Local Authority Level so we can't calculate a <em>positivity rate</em>. Instead we have to use daily cases per 100k. As this figure is quite variable daily we don't use the raw figures but instead use the 7-day-rolling-average (as in the graph above). We also ignore the dashed-line segment in the graph (recent days under-report) and use the most recent point of the solid section.</p>
			<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
			<p>Daily cases shows a smoothed 7-day rolling average (+/3 days of the day in question) of confirmed cases by specimen date. The smoothing hides some of the "noise" in the daily data and smooths out the weekend effect. The big figure we show is this smoothed value as of 5 days ago (in the data). We ignore the most recent days because the data is still coming in and the current value under-estimates the "final" figures for those dates.</p>
			<p><em><strong>Total deaths</strong></em> gives the total of all deaths in a Local Authority i.e. deaths by any cause including COVID-19. <em><strong>Total COVID-19 deaths</strong></em> gives all deaths that the Office of National Statistics has noted as being related to COVID-19. <em><strong>Total COVID-19 deaths as a percent of total deaths</strong></em> takes the <em><strong>Total COVID-19 deaths</strong></em> and divides it by <em><strong>Total deaths</strong></em> to find the percentage of deaths which were related to COVID-19. In pre-COVID times it is known that some areas have more deaths per capita than others because they may have older populations. Therefore the percentage may help compare across authorities with very different figures. The ONS publish death data once per week on a Tuesday.</p>
			<p>Population data now comes from estimates from the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS) rather than 2019 ONS estimates.</p>
