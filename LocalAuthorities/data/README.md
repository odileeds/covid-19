# Data

## Confirmed cases

Tom White compiles [UK historical data](https://github.com/tomwhite/covid-19-uk-data) from the various national agencies (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland). Previously we took data for England direct from the Public Health England dashboard but on 14th April they changed how that works and it no longer has a fixed URL to download the latest data from. We only use [Tom's UK data now](https://github.com/tomwhite/covid-19-uk-data/blob/master/data/covid-19-cases-uk.csv). To keep page load down, we are creating [a processed version of Tom's data](utla.json) every 15 minutes.

## Populations

~~[Public Health England](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-track-coronavirus-cases) provide [COVID-19 cases as a CSV](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=b684319181f94875a6879bbc833ca3a6).~~ [Confirmed cases for England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland](https://github.com/tomwhite/covid-19-uk-data/blob/master/data/covid-19-cases-uk.csv) are collated by Tom White.

The populations for England mostly come from [ONS population estimates](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/datasets/localauthoritiesinenglandtable2) extracted to [populations.csv](populations.csv).
